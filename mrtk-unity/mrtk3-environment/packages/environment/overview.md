# Environment &#8212; MRTK3

The `com.microsoft.mrtk.environment` package has been deprecated. Use the existing [ARFoundation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@5.0/api/UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARMeshManager.html) and [XRInputSubsystem](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/XR.XRInputSubsystem.html) APIs from Unity for spatial mesh visualization and boundary queries, respectively.
